## Description
NYC Drop-Off Locations is a map that displays all textile, food scrap, leaf, pharmaceutical, and electronic drop-off locations in New York City. Users can enter their zip code to find the nearest drop-off location. Additionally, users can hover over each marker on the map to find more information, like the site name, address, and website. By default, all drop-off location categories are displayed, but users can uncheck certain drop-off categories on the top right-side menu of the map.
